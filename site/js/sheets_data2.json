Funded by a Digital Humanities Implementation Grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, this software addresses the greatest challenge for building knowledge through the use of three-dimensional computer models by providing scholars and educators the mechanism to explore, annotate, craft narratives, and build arguments within the 3D space \u2013 in essence, facilitating the creation of virtual learning environments that can be broadly disseminated to educators and learners across grade levels and humanities disciplines.</p>\n\n<h2>VSim 2.0 BETA Version Now Available!</h2>\n\n<p>VSim 2.0 BETA is now available for downloading and testing in both Windows and Mac versions! VSim 2.0 offers significant improvements over the prototype, and includes advanced font and text controls, scroll bars for both the Narrative and Embedded Resources Bars, more file import options, and improved filtering and editing capabilities for the embedded resources, among many new and improved features. The software is also responsive, so narrative overlays will adapt to changes in the size of the simulation window.  VSim was funded by the NEH, and the beta files were posted in December 2018. Please report any reproducible problems to Lisa M. Snyder.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../downloads/VSim_BETA_Windows_Dec2018.zip\">The Windows BETA version of VSim 2.0.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../downloads/VSim_BETA_Mac_Dec2018.tar.gz\">The Mac BETA version of VSim 2.0.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../downloads/VSim_AbridgedUsersGuide_Dec20_2018.pdf\">VSim 2.0 Abridged Users Guide.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../downloads/Pantheon_UCLA_Dec2018.vsim\">The Pantheon test model for use with VSim 2.0.</a></li>\n</ul>",

            "Most would agree that in terms of creating virtual experiences as part of research, more context is better. Contextual information allows for a bigger picture to be seen and can provide in situ understanding, despite being remote. With the proliferation of 360 cameras, creating immersive virtual tours has become more commonplace. Whether it is to document the layout of a hydroelectric power plant, provide archival information about historical relics, such as the HMAS OVENS submarine, or share information regarding a cultural heritage site, such as Google Arts and Culture\u2019s Street View tours, immersive 360 capture with annotations has become a strong visual research method and product. In addition, many fields of research look to present information or scenarios and then survey a sample of participants regarding their experience. Interactive surveys or modules can provide valuable research data for any number of disciplines. In this workshop, participants will be introduced to Adobe Captivate, a software for building e-learning interactives and annotated 360 virtual tours. Focusing on examples that bridge UCLA\u2019s Biomedical Library space and digital collections, participants will learn how to build a virtual tour with 360 images and video. They will also learn how to annotate their tours with collections materials and how to build some of the platforms various interactive activities, which include: Multiple choice True/False Fill-in-the-blank Short Answer Matching Hot Spot Sequence Rating scale Random question No prior experience with Adobe products will be needed. However, this product is not part of the Adobe Creative Cloud Suite. If participants want to follow along during the workshop, they will need to purchase and download Adobe Captivate before the workshop.

            "NFTs seem to be everywhere now. NFT stands for non fungible tokens. The creation and exchange of NFTs has been revolutionary in many ways, particularly in terms of arts and services markets. For example, in the art market, NFTs use blockchain technology to allow for the secure transfer and proof that an original piece of digital art has been sold and is now in the possession of the buyer. It also allows for what we in art history may refer to as provenance of an artwork to be more carefully tracked. The benefits of blockchain is that it enables a global secure transfer of private smart contracts between parties that are stored on an open decentralized network. The result has exposed art market sales more openly and shifted the value of digital art drastically. In this workshop you will learn about rarity, royalties, and crypto wallets. We will look at some examples of the way NFTs are being used in different markets, but will focus most specifically on growing digital art markets. You will also learn how to set up your own crypto wallet, create your own NFT, and begin mining Ethereum, a popular crypto currency, which is used in the buying and selling of many NFT artworks and items.

Increasing stability in digital visual scholarship means working from authority files from museums, libraries, and archives \u2014 institutions are committed to long term preservation and standards. This workshop will introduce participants to Mirador, an \u201copen-source, web based, multi-window image viewing platform with the ability to zoom, display, compare and annotate images from around the world.\u201d Leveraging the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF), the Mirador web-viewer allows users to compare and annotate images and documents. Participants will learn how to install a local instance of Mirador, find Mirador-friendly content and resources, make narratives with annotations, and complete side-by-side transcriptions. All levels are welcome.",

            "3D models can be formed in a number of ways. Two common surveying methods that result in 3D models are photogrammetry and light detection and ranging or lidar for short. A form of photogrammetry has been around since the beginnings of photography in the mid-19th century. The term usually refers to the method by which 2D images are compared and combined using optics, projective geometry, and computing to produce a 3D model. This method of image overlap to create a dimensional model is applied in many object-oriented disciplines such as archeology, topographic mapping, architecture, engineering, manufacturing, quality control, police investigation, cultural heritage, and geology. Lidar is a method for measuring distances (ranging) by illuminating the target with laser light and measuring the reflection with a sensor. Differences in laser return times and wavelengths can then be used to make digital 3D representations of the target. While long used in the earth sciences, lidar is becoming increasingly available to all as these sensors are being added to cellular mobile devices, increasing its academic and commercial potential. In this workshop, participants will learn about the hardware and software required for these methods. We will also cover the workflow that is involved in producing photogrammetric and lidar 3D models. All levels welcome.

Her dissertation \"Virtual Actualities: Technology, Museums, and Immersion\" (2019) interrogates modes of publishing, display, and information capture in museums and archives that illustrate a break from \u201ctraditional\u201d models, and argues that digital modalities provide a distinctly different paradigm for epistemologies of art and culture that offer greater contextualized understandings.",

This book delves deep into the ethical challenges posed by artificial intelligence, especially in terms of bias and discrimination. Buolamwini, a renowned computer scientist and activist, combines her personal experiences with rigorous research to expose the often-hidden biases embedded in AI systems.</span></p><h3 class=\"c8\" id=\"h.rb00x0e5ob5t\"><span class=\"c9 c0\">A Journey Through AI&#39;s Ethical Landscape</span></h3><p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c3\">Unmasking AI</span><span class=\"c2\">&nbsp;is more than just a critique of technology; it&rsquo;s a call to action. Buolamwini draws on her groundbreaking work with the Algorithmic Justice League to highlight how AI systems can perpetuate and even amplify societal inequalities. She examines the historical context of these biases, linking them to broader issues of race, gender, and power.</span></p><p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c2\">For students and educators in Digital Humanities, this book is an essential resource. It provides a framework for understanding the intersection of technology, ethics, and society&mdash;a key concern for anyone studying how digital tools impact the human experience.</span></p><h3 class=\"c8\" id=\"h.avt7omradftb\"><span class=\"c9 c0\">Key Themes, Insights, and Projects</span></h3><p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c2\">One of the book&#39;s most powerful messages is the idea that technology is not neutral. Buolamwini reveals how AI systems, often seen as objective and impartial, can reflect and reinforce the prejudices of their creators. This is particularly evident in facial recognition technologies, which have been shown to misidentify people of color at alarmingly high rates. </span></p><p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c2\">Buolamwini&rsquo;s narrative is also deeply personal. She shares her journey from being a student encountering biased AI in her research to becoming a leading voice advocating for fairness in technology. This personal touch makes the book not only informative but also deeply engaging.</span></p><p class=\"c7\"><span>As an artist and a programmer, Buolamwini has produced videos that emphasize key aspects of her work.
